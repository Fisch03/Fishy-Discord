# Fishy-Discord
A transparent and clean Discord Theme, loosely based on [Sushy's "Sushy/acrylic" Theme](https://github.com/CrypticShy/acrylic).
To use this, you need a CSS injector like [BandagedBD](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp), [BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord) or [EnhancedDiscord](https://github.com/joe27g/EnhancedDiscord).
You will also need [Glasscord](https://github.com/AryToNeX/Glasscord) for the transparency.
Please refer to the wiki of your chosen Injector and Glasscord for installation Instructions.
